Alpine.js Integration Issues and Fixes in single-product.php
1. Alpine.js Inclusion and Version

The project uses Alpine.js v3.x (the latest 3.x series) for interactivity. According to the project docs, Alpine is added via a CDN script in the theme header. Ensure the script is correctly included with the proper version (e.g. Alpine v3.14) and with the defer attribute so it loads after HTML. If Alpine’s script is missing or loaded incorrectly, none of the x-data and directives will function. Recommendation: Add the Alpine CDN <script> in the <head> (or enqueue it in functions.php) with defer (e.g. <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>), to initialize Alpine after DOM content is ready. This will ensure all Alpine directives on the page become active.
2. "Lisa korvi" Modal Not Opening on Click

The “Lisa korvi” (Add to Cart) button is currently a plain form submit button with no Alpine click binding. When clicked, it triggers a page reload (standard WooCommerce behavior) before any modal can show. The Alpine state showCartModal (defined in x-data) is never set to true because no code ties the button to this state. To fix this:

    Implement an Alpine click trigger or AJAX: For example, use @click.prevent="/* add to cart via AJAX */ showCartModal = true; cartQuantity = ...; cartProduct = ..." on the button. This would intercept the click, use JavaScript to add the item to cart in the background, and then set showCartModal = true to open the modal. WooCommerce provides AJAX endpoints/events (e.g. the added_to_cart event) that you can hook into. Since the project avoids jQuery, you can use fetch() to call ?add-to-cart=<id>&quantity=<q> and then set showCartModal on success.

    Ensure the modal uses correct state variables: The modal markup expects <span x-text="quantity"> and <span x-text="productName">, but these are not defined in Alpine data (the data uses cartQuantity and cartProduct instead). This is likely why the modal text is empty and could even throw errors. Use the existing state or rename consistently (e.g. bind x-text="cartQuantity" and x-text="cartProduct.name" if cartProduct holds an object, or define productName in x-data). For example:

    x-data="{ showCartModal: false, cartQuantity: 0, cartProduct: null, ... }"

    And when adding to cart via Alpine, set cartQuantity and cartProduct (or productName) accordingly before showCartModal = true. This ensures the modal shows the correct product and quantity added.

By handling the add-to-cart click with Alpine (preventing default form submit), you’ll stay on the page and be able to trigger the “Added to cart” modal as intended. If using WooCommerce’s built-in AJAX (which normally relies on jQuery), consider writing a small Alpine-compatible script or enabling WooCommerce’s AJAX by enqueuing the necessary script. The key is that the event to toggle showCartModal must fire, otherwise the modal’s x-show will never turn true.
3. Product Tabs Always Open (Accordion Issue)

On the product page, the accordion tabs (Description, “Lisainfo” additional info, “Tarneinfo” shipping info, etc.) are meant to be collapsible, controlled by Alpine. The state variable openAccordion is defined in the root x-data and initially null (meaning all accordions should start closed). Each accordion button toggles this state (e.g., clicking Lisainfo sets openAccordion = 'additional' or back to null), and the content panels use x-show="openAccordion === 'additional'" (with transitions) to reveal or hide content.

If all tabs are always visible and not collapsing, it indicates the Alpine logic isn’t running correctly. Possible causes and fixes:

    Alpine not initializing due to a script error: If Alpine fails to start (e.g. due to a JS error elsewhere on the page), none of the x-show directives will work – thus all accordion content remains visible by default. Indeed, in the reviews section there is an undefined Alpine variable error (see point 5) that likely halts Alpine execution. Fixing those errors will allow Alpine to initialize and apply the x-show conditions, hiding panels until triggered.

    Missing x-cloak on accordion content: The first accordion panel has x-cloak (which, with proper CSS, keeps it hidden until Alpine is ready), but the subsequent panel (Tarneinfo) lacks x-cloak. This can cause a flash of content. Ensure every initially closed panel uses x-cloak and that the stylesheet has [x-cloak] { display: none; } so they start hidden. For consistency, add x-cloak to all x-show content sections that should start collapsed.

    Verify scope: The accordion code is inside the main Alpine component (no nested component interfering), so openAccordion is in scope for those @click and x-show directives. The logic itself is correct – toggling a string key. Once Alpine is running, clicking a tab header should set openAccordion appropriately, and Alpine will show the matching panel (and rotate the chevron icon via :class="...rotate-180..." binding).

Recommendation: Fix the underlying Alpine load issues so that openAccordion reactivity works. Then, test that only the clicked section opens. Also consider improving accessibility: use proper <button> elements (as done) and perhaps ARIA attributes for accordions. With Alpine active, the tabs will default closed (since openAccordion = null means x-show conditions are false) and open on click as intended.
4. "Lisa arvustus" Button Not Working

Clicking “Lisa arvustus” (Add Review) should open a form modal for submitting a review. In the code, this button is inside the reviews section and uses @click="$root.showModal = true". The intention is to set the root Alpine state showModal to true, which should trigger a <template x-if="$root.showModal"> that contains the review form modal.

If nothing happens on click, the likely issues are:

    Same Alpine initialization problem: As with the tabs, if Alpine isn’t running due to an earlier error, the click directive won’t do anything. Once Alpine errors are resolved, $root.showModal = true will actually mutate the state.

    Scope and $root usage: The use of $root here suggests that the reviews section might be a nested Alpine component. It appears the reviews slider was intended to have its own x-data (for horizontal scroll state) wrapping the reviews list. If so, $root.showModal correctly targets the root component’s showModal. Make sure that is indeed needed. Alternatively, you can avoid $root by not wrapping the entire reviews section in a new x-data. In practice, the code did not define a new x-data for the reviews section (which led to errors), so the button could just use @click="showModal = true" in the root scope. Both approaches can work, but be consistent.

    Ensure the modal exists: The review form modal is defined in a <template x-if="$root.showModal"> block further down. If Alpine is working, clicking the button should insert that template into the DOM. Verify that the template is present (it is in the code) and that it encloses the form properly. After fixing the Alpine data errors, test the flow: clicking “Lisa arvustus” should set showModal:true, injecting the form modal. Also verify the modal’s close button (@click="$root.showModal = false") closes it, and that on successful submit, it sets showSuccessModal (for the thank-you message).

In summary, the review modal likely failed because Alpine was breaking entirely. Once you correct Alpine’s initialization and variable issues, the $root.showModal toggle will function, and the Add Review modal should open as expected when the button is clicked.
5. JavaScript Errors and Conflicts

Several script issues in the code are causing Alpine or other JS to malfunction:

    Undefined Alpine variables (Reviews section): In the reviews slider, the code references fadeDistance, leftOpacity, rightOpacity in the Alpine directives, but does not define them in any x-data. This is a bug. For example, the @scroll handler does const fade = fadeDistance; leftOpacity = ...; rightOpacity = ..., but no x-data="{ fadeDistance: ..., leftOpacity: ..., rightOpacity: ...}" is present on the container (unlike the related products section, which correctly sets x-data="{ leftOpacity: 0, rightOpacity: 0, fadeDistance: 50 }"). Consequently, Alpine throws a ReferenceError when initializing this section. This prevents all Alpine components on the page from functioning. Fix: Add the missing x-data. For example:

<div class="relative -mx-2" x-data="{ leftOpacity: 0, rightOpacity: 0, fadeDistance: 80 }">
    <!-- Reviews slider content -->
</div>

Use a suitable fadeDistance (e.g. 80px as per design specs). This will provide the reactive state for the @scroll calculations and the gradient overlays’ x-show bindings. After this fix, the horizontal reviews carousel will work and Alpine will no longer error out during initialization.

Mismatch in cart modal state: As noted, the “Added to cart” confirmation modal uses x-text="quantity" and x-text="productName", but the Alpine state uses cartQuantity and cartProduct. Without matching names, Alpine can’t find those variables (resulting in blank text or errors). Fix: Change these bindings to use the correct state names (cartQuantity and cartProduct) or adjust the x-data to include quantity and productName. For example, if cartProduct is meant to hold the product’s name, you could do: cartProduct: '', and then set cartProduct = productName when adding to cart, and bind x-text="cartProduct". The easiest fix is to use the existing cartQuantity and cartProduct:

    <span x-text="cartQuantity"></span>x <span x-text="cartProduct"></span>

    (assuming cartProduct stores the product name string). This ensures the modal shows the correct info.

    WooCommerce variation script: If the product is variable, WooCommerce’s standard variation script (which updates price and availability on option change) may not be loaded, since the theme avoids jQuery. The code outputs the <select> for attributes but doesn’t include the usual wc-add-to-cart-variation.js. This could be a conflict if not addressed. Users might select a variant and click add-to-cart without feedback if, say, a variant is out of stock. Recommendation: Implement variant selection handling in Alpine if needed (e.g., disable the add button until a variant is chosen, show variant-specific price). This ensures no loss of functionality despite not using the default script.

    General JS conflicts: No major syntax errors were found in the file (the stray } in the snippet was just closing PHP conditions). The custom JS for quantity buttons is guarded and straightforward. However, note that this could have been done in Alpine as well (see best practices below). Make sure no other libraries (e.g. Fancybox) are conflicting: Fancybox is included via CDN as well and initialized on [data-fancybox] selectors on DOMContentLoaded, which should be fine. Just ensure Alpine’s deferred initialization doesn’t interfere with Fancybox (loading order matters: include Alpine after Fancybox if Fancybox is needed early, or vice versa depending on usage).

    WooCommerce default classes: The theme removes WooCommerce’s default classes (like button, single_add_to_cart_button) to use pure Tailwind styling. This is okay, but be aware that some WooCommerce JS relies on classes or triggers. Since we’re handling add-to-cart via custom means, it’s not a big issue. Just ensure any WooCommerce feature you want to preserve is manually handled.

By fixing the undefined Alpine data and aligning variable names, the JavaScript errors will be resolved. Always check the browser console for errors: a single uncaught error can halt all subsequent Alpine processing. After applying these fixes, you should see Alpine directives working and no JS errors in the console.
6. Alpine.js & Tailwind CSS 4.0 Best Practices Review

Finally, let’s ensure the code follows Tailwind 4.0 and Alpine 3 best practices:

    Utility-First Classes: The code heavily uses Tailwind utility classes (e.g. grid, flex, p-4, text-gray-700, etc.) as intended, with minimal custom CSS. This aligns with the project’s “Tailwind-first” mandate. One suggestion: avoid nesting Tailwind’s .container class unnecessarily. In the template, there is a container mx-auto max-w-7xl wrapping the main content and another container max-w-7xl inside the reviews section. Typically, you’d use a single main container to center content; nested containers can cause inconsistent padding. Consider using a <section> with max-w-7xl mx-auto for reviews rather than another “container” inside a container for cleaner structure.

    Semantic Markup: The theme aims for semantic HTML5. Currently, some semantic elements are used (e.g. the breadcrumb nav uses <nav>, and headings are hierarchical). However, the main product content is wrapped in generic <div>s. Prefer using a <main> tag for the primary content area of the page and an <article> around the product details, since each product is a distinct piece of content. For example:

    <main class="container ...">
      <article class="bg-white ..."> ... </article>
    </main>

    This improves semantics and accessibility (screen readers will identify main content and product section properly). Similarly, the reviews block could be an <section> with an appropriate aria-label.

    Proper x-data Scope: Alpine best practice is to keep state localized to components. The code currently has one large x-data on the main product wrapper (holding modals and accordion state) and separate smaller x-data for the gallery, related products slider, etc. This is good. One improvement: wrap only what needs independent state. For the reviews carousel, instead of making the entire reviews section an Alpine component (which necessitated $root for the button), you can scope x-data just to the scrollable carousel div (as done with related products). This way, the “Add review” button remains in the root scope and can use a simpler @click="showModal=true". In short, avoid overly broad x-data that encompass other interactive elements unless needed. Keep using $root only when you intentionally need to reach into parent state from a nested component (e.g. the review form modal uses $root.showModal inside its own x-data, which is fine).

    Alpine vs Custom JS: The project philosophy is “Alpine.js first” for interactivity. In a few places, custom JS was used where Alpine could suffice. For example, the quantity plus/minus buttons are handled with plain DOM selectors and event listeners. This works, but you could simplify by leveraging Alpine: e.g., in x-data have quantity: 1 and use <button @click="quantity = Math.max(1, quantity-1)">−</button> and <button @click="if(quantity < max) quantity++">+</button> with x-model="quantity" on the input. This would remove the need for an external script and keep all logic declarative in the template. It’s not “wrong” to use vanilla JS (especially as it’s small and contained), but aligning with Alpine for these interactions keeps the code consistent with the no-plugin, no-jQuery approach.

    Tailwind 4.0 conventions: The code uses modern classes like aspect-square, [appearance:none] and custom utilities (e.g. scrollbar-hide, line-clamp-2). Ensure that these come from Tailwind plugins or are defined, because Tailwind 4.0 might require enabling certain plugins (aspect-ratio, lineClamp, etc.). The presence of text-2xs suggests a custom font-size scale was added – that’s fine if configured. Just verify the Tailwind config includes all customizations used. No deprecated classes from v3 were noticed (which is good, as v4 removed some). For example, the use of hover:-translate-y-0.5 and transition-all is correct.

    Styling and Structure: The markup is generally clean and follows the design system (lots of utility classes, BEM-like comments). Make sure to remove any development-only comments or redundant code (there is duplicate “Related Products” logic – one custom by SKU and one default WooCommerce loop at the bottom – ensure only one is intended to display). Also, maintain consistency in using brand colors via CSS variables or config (e.g. text-brand-600 is used, implying a custom color named "brand" is set up – verify it’s consistently applied).

In summary, after fixing the functional issues, the template largely adheres to best practices. It embraces Tailwind’s utility-first styling and Alpine’s declarative JS as mandated. The remaining improvements are about refining semantics and ensuring all dynamic behavior is handled the “Alpine way”. By implementing these recommendations – correct script inclusion, fixing Alpine errors, hooking up the modals, and cleaning up markup – the single product page will be fully functional and maintainable, in line with Tailwind 4.0 and Alpine.js guidelines.
