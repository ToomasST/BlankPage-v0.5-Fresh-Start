# Changelog

All notable changes to TailPress will be documented in this file.

## BlankPage v0.5.7 - 2025-06-30

### Added - WooCommerce Image Size Smart Consolidation
- **Smart Consolidation Detection**: Admin tool now detects when WordPress and WooCommerce image sizes share identical dimensions
- **Accurate File Count**: Shows both active size count and actual generated file count (considering consolidation)
- **Unified Display Logic**: All UI elements now use consistent dimension display (e.g., `180xauto` for uncropped images)
- **Real Savings Calculation**: Percentage reflects actual disk space saved from disabled sizes + smart consolidation
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Updated summary cards to show "Genereerituid faile" instead of misleading metrics

### Fixed - Image Size Admin Tool
- Fixed active sizes block to match table display logic (`180xauto` vs `180x180`)
- Fixed consolidation logic to properly detect uncropped size matches (width-only comparison)
- Fixed summary statistics to account for smart file sharing between WP and WC sizes
- Improved dimension comparison accuracy using table rendering logic
- Removed debug output for production-ready interface

### Technical Implementation
- Implemented dimension collection during table rendering for accurate comparisons
- Added smart matching logic for cropped vs uncropped image size consolidation
- Enhanced admin tool UI with consistent display formatting across all blocks
- Optimized calculation performance by reusing table dimension data
